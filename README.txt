Now with Settings mode!

Good app to follow changes of currency.
The app sends a mail with currency's change.
It happens every time when change is bigger or equals an edge that you may tune as you need.
Than currency will be compared to the value that was sent last time.(Edges will be recomputed)
It easily maybe improved with adding possibility to follow any currency.
(Now it follows $/₽)

Also you may write any text you like that will warn you about currency's change.
